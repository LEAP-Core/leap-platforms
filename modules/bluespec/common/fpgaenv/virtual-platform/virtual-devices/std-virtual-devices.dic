// Define a NULL virtual devices dictionary entry so there will be a handle
// for virtual devices to find their entries.  Some virtual devices, such as
// scratchpad memory, change their interfaces for clients that register for
// connections using dictionary entries.  The handle declared here makes it
// possible for virtual devices to compile even when no clients are registered.
