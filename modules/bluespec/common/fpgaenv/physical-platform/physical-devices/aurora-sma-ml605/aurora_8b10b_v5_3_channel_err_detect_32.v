//  CHANNEL_ERR_DETECT
//
//
//  Description: the CHANNEL_ERR_DETECT module monitors the error signals
//               from the Aurora Lanes in the channel.  If one or more errors
//               are detected, the error is reported as a channel error.  If
//               a hard error is detected, it sends a message to the channel
//               initialization state machine to reset the channel.
//
//               This module supports 1 4-byte lane designs
//
