There are two implementations of differential clocks.  Both implementations
provide a model clock at the requested frequency (AWB parameter
MODEL_CLOCK_FREQ).  Both also provide a soft reset, triggered by
softResetTrigger.

Differential clocks from clocks converts a pair of Bluespec Clock types
into a differential clock.  Most likely these clocks come from top-level
clocks.

Differential clocks from wires first convert clocks that are passed in
as enable wires on methods into Bluespec Clock types.  Then the processing
is the same as the clocks from clocks above.
