All files beginning with "mig_" are straight out of the memory interface generator
in Vivado 2014.4 with the following settings:

FPGA Family:            Virtex-7
FPGA Part:              xc7vx485t-ffg1761
Speed Grade:            -2
Design Entry:           Verilog

Component Name:         mig_7series_0
Number of controllers:  1
AXI4 Interface:         No

Controller type:        DDR3 SDRAM

Clock period:           1250 ps (800 MHz)
Memory type:            SODIMMs
Memory part:            MT8JTF12864HZ-1G6
Data Mask:              Enabled
Ordering:               Normal

Input clock period:     5000 ps (200 MHz)
Read burst type:        Sequential
Output driver:          RZQ/7 (High)
Controller chip select: Enable
RTT (nominal):          RZQ/6
Memory address map:     BANK ROW COLUMN

System clock:           No buffer.  (We build a differential clock in
                        the Bluespec code and pass it in. The pin assignments
                        we use for the Bluespec-constructed clock are the
                        pins that are assigned when differential is picked
                        here.)
Reference clock:        Use system clock
System reset polarity:  Active low
Debug signals:          Off
Interval Vref:          Off
IO power reduction:     On
XADC instantiation:     Enabled

DCI cascade:            Off

Pin/Bank selection mode: Fixed pin out

Bank selection for controller 0:  Read XDC/UCF (e.g. use example_top.xdc from
                                  VC707 DDR3 example design.)
Status signals:         Ignore (defined later)
