//  ERR_DETECT_GTP
//
//
//  Description : The ERR_DETECT module monitors the GTP to detect hard
//                errors.  It accumulates the Soft errors according to the
//                leaky bucket algorithm described in the Aurora
//                Specification to detect Hard errors.  All errors are
//                reported to the Global Logic Interface.
//
//                * Supports GTP
