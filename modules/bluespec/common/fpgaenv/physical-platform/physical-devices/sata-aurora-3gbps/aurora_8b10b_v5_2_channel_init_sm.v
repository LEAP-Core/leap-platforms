//  CHANNEL_INIT_SM
//
//
//  Description: the CHANNEL_INIT_SM module is a state machine for managing channel
//               bonding and verification.
//
//               The channel init state machine is reset until the lane up signals
//               of all the lanes that constitute the channel are asserted.  It then
//               requests channel bonding until the lanes have been bonded and
//               checks to make sure the bonding was successful.  Channel bonding is
//               skipped if there is only one lane in the channel.  If bonding is
//               unsuccessful, the lanes are reset.
//
//               After the bonding phase is complete, the state machine sends
//               verification sequences through the channel until it is clear that
//               the channel is ready to be used.  If verification is successful,
//               the CHANNEL_UP signal is asserted.  If it is unsuccessful, the
//               lanes are reset.
//
//               After CHANNEL_UP goes high, the state machine is quiescent, and will
//               reset only if one of the lanes goes down, a hard error is detected, or
//               a general reset is requested.
//
//               This module supports 1 2-byte lane designs
