This directory tree builds programs and drivers that populate the /usr/hasim
tree on machines with FPGA devices.  The files must be on a local disk because
they are either setuid root, loaded as kernel drivers or are links to machine-
specific files.

To populate /usr/hasim for a machine, do the following in this directory.

  A.  make

  B.  sudo make install

  C.  Populate the links in /usr/hasim/dev.  For PCIe-based FPGA cards
      this probably means two links:

      1.  /usr/hasim/dev/pcie_fpga_power0 -> the PCIe power controller file,
          e.g. /sys/bus/pci/slots/1/power

      2.  /usr/hasim/dev/usb_programming_cable0 -> the Xilinx USB programming
          cable device, e.g. /dev/windrvr6



Notes on hotplug:

For PCIe hotplug most machines generate errors if the PCIe card is electrically
present but not offering a true PCIe interface at boot time.  Hitech Global
ships their cards with flashing LEDs and no PCIe interface, by default.
We must replace the default startup FPGA image with one that handles PCIe.
Do the following:

  A.  Get an .mcs file for programming the PROM that has PCIe support.
      Either:

      1. Recommended:
         Build any HAsim model that includes PCIe support.  Find the .bit
         file in the pm/.xilinx directory and generate an MCS file for
         loading in the PROM using:

           promgen -u 0 <model>_par.bit

         if you do this it will come up was a "Xilinx" card name and a
         vendor id 0x10ee

      or

      2. Use the sample file that came with the HighTech Global card at
           /proj/asim/www/html/documentation/HAsim/other/HiTech_Global_LX110T_CD/Reference_Designs

         if you do this the card will come up as "unknown" with a vendor id
         of 0x19aa and device id 0xe004

  B.  Use Xilinx "impact" tool to program the .mcs file in the
      PROM.  Notes:

      1.  You must set the "Parallel Mode" option during programming.

      1.  You must erase the PROM before programming it.  Failure to do so
          will trigger errors during programming with no explanation.

      2.  Xilinx impact from ISE tools 10.1 seems abort on an attempt to
          erase the PROM.  impact from 9.1i seems to work.



Some other README files in this directory (e.g. README.dev) may appear confusing
here.  They are installed in /usr/hasim and attempt to explain details of
subdirectories of /usr/hasim.
