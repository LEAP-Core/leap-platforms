FPGAenv Reorganization: A new module called
low-level-platform-interface (LLPI) now encapsulates RRR,
Channel I/O, and Top Level Wires. The higher level HAsim
Platform Interface instantiates the LLPI and passes it down
to all the virtual devices, which can choose to use any
of the three mechanisms (RRR, ChannelIO, TopLevelWires) to
implement their functionality.

This commit only updates the AWB hierarchy to reflect the
new organization. The directory structure is slightly
inconsistent, and will be fixed in a future commit.

Added support for "Simulation only" memory virtual device which uses BRAM and
never issues invalidates. This can serve as a template for the Hybrid Memory BSV
side.

These are the drivers needed to connect the Xilinx USB Programming Cable.
This check-in is the unmodified drivers as downloaded from a few web sites.

- Interim Checkin: added partial support for virtual memory device.
  Memory is not yet operational, but existing models should work
  as before.

- moved all sofware-partition source files from .c to .cpp

- updated Hybrid Memory. Some basic functionalities now work.
  Please see MemTest.bsv for an example on how to use it.

- modified Hybrid Front Panel to poll RRR every few cycles
  instead of every cycle. This gives other RRR clients a chance
  to win during rule scheduling (currently, RRR arbitration is
  solely through implicit Bluespec rule-scheduling).
