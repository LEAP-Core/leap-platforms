FPGAenv Reorganization: A new module called
low-level-platform-interface (LLPI) now encapsulates RRR,
Channel I/O, and Top Level Wires. The higher level HAsim
Platform Interface instantiates the LLPI and passes it down
to all the virtual devices, which can choose to use any
of the three mechanisms (RRR, ChannelIO, TopLevelWires) to
implement their functionality.

This commit only updates the AWB hierarchy to reflect the
new organization. The directory structure is slightly
inconsistent, and will be fixed in a future commit.

Added support for "Simulation only" memory virtual device which uses BRAM and
never issues invalidates. This can serve as a template for the Hybrid Memory BSV
side.

- updated Hybrid Memory. Some basic functionalities now work.
  Please see MemTest.bsv for an example on how to use it.

- modified Hybrid Front Panel to poll RRR every few cycles
  instead of every cycle. This gives other RRR clients a chance
  to win during rule scheduling (currently, RRR arbitration is
  solely through implicit Bluespec rule-scheduling).

  Just use std-virtual-devices.

- changed the method used to launch a hybrid model. The software
  executable needs to be invoked by the user, which will in turn
  launch the hardware part of the simulation (this will be later
  extended to enable the software executable to download the bitfile
  onto the FPGA for a "real" hybrid execution).

- cleaned up the BSV-side of the sim-channelio module significantly;
  some of the functionality has now been transferred to the software
  side.

- updated the way in which software services handle exceptions:
  instead of exiting immediately, they send a message to the server
  so that it can perform some cleanup operations (terminating all
  other services and the hardware simulation) before exiting.
  This method is also used to terminate simulation if the user
  clicks on the Exit button on the front panel.

- added support for loading a VMH image into the hybrid
  memory module's software partition. Hybrid SMIPS models
  are now able to run VMH benchmarks by streaming them in
  from the software partition.

  This was tested using a hybrid version of the SMPIS
  5-stage pipeline coupled with the V2 functional partition
  on the microbenchmarks. All 5 microbenchmarks complete
  successfully.

  However, there are some timing discrepancies between the
  event logs of the hybrid and pure simulations, although
  the sequence of events appears to be the same. I will
  examine these more thoroughly.

- added support for specifying a VMH file as a command-line
  parameter to the host software executable. If no
  parameter is provided, "program.vmh" is assumed to be
  the VMH image to be loaded, and should be present in the
  current directory. Since the benchmark setup script has
  not been updated to support hybrid models, as of now the
  VMH benchmark name needs to be explicitly provided for
  launching hybrid simulations.

- fixed a major bug in the software RRR server and memory
  service: void service methods were not being handled
  properly and were returning a 0 result on channelio.

- sim-channelio now uses a unique set of well-known
  descriptors (100 and 101) to communicate, freeing up
  STDIN and STDOUT for use by $display etc.

- changed programming style of RRR services from procedural to
  to a more ASIM-like object-oriented style. However, the RRR
  service objects are currently not dynamically instantiated by
  the server; they are statically instantiated as global variables
  within the modules themselves, and the server accesses them
  via extern pointers.

- all RRR services now have a Clock() method that is called by
  the software RRR server's clock() method.

- hybrid Front Panel's Clock() synchronizes its cached state
  with the Perl dialog box, while the Request() method simply
  returns/updates the local cached state.

- the server's main() has been removed, and the functionality
  has been moved to its clock method() which is called by the
  software controller in an infinite loop.

- moved software channelio functionality from RRR server to channelio
  module. All RRR code is now physical-platform-independent.

- encapsulated RRR server functions in a RRR server class.

- renamed Clock() to Poll() in RRR server and services.

- merged the sendReq and sendVoidReq methods in hardware RRR
  client into a single method makeRequest, with a bool paramter
  which specifies whether a response is expected or not.

- cleaned up some of the hardware RRR code.
