FPGAenv Reorganization: A new module called
low-level-platform-interface (LLPI) now encapsulates RRR,
Channel I/O, and Top Level Wires. The higher level HAsim
Platform Interface instantiates the LLPI and passes it down
to all the virtual devices, which can choose to use any
of the three mechanisms (RRR, ChannelIO, TopLevelWires) to
implement their functionality.

This commit only updates the AWB hierarchy to reflect the
new organization. The directory structure is slightly
inconsistent, and will be fixed in a future commit.

Added support for "Simulation only" memory virtual device which uses BRAM and
never issues invalidates. This can serve as a template for the Hybrid Memory BSV
side.

- updated Hybrid Memory. Some basic functionalities now work.
  Please see MemTest.bsv for an example on how to use it.

- modified Hybrid Front Panel to poll RRR every few cycles
  instead of every cycle. This gives other RRR clients a chance
  to win during rule scheduling (currently, RRR arbitration is
  solely through implicit Bluespec rule-scheduling).

- changed the method used to launch a hybrid model. The software
  executable needs to be invoked by the user, which will in turn
  launch the hardware part of the simulation (this will be later
  extended to enable the software executable to download the bitfile
  onto the FPGA for a "real" hybrid execution).

- cleaned up the BSV-side of the sim-channelio module significantly;
  some of the functionality has now been transferred to the software
  side.

- updated the way in which software services handle exceptions:
  instead of exiting immediately, they send a message to the server
  so that it can perform some cleanup operations (terminating all
  other services and the hardware simulation) before exiting.
  This method is also used to terminate simulation if the user
  clicks on the Exit button on the front panel.

- added support for loading a VMH image into the hybrid
  memory module's software partition. Hybrid SMIPS models
  are now able to run VMH benchmarks by streaming them in
  from the software partition.

  This was tested using a hybrid version of the SMPIS
  5-stage pipeline coupled with the V2 functional partition
  on the microbenchmarks. All 5 microbenchmarks complete
  successfully.

  However, there are some timing discrepancies between the
  event logs of the hybrid and pure simulations, although
  the sequence of events appears to be the same. I will
  examine these more thoroughly.

- added support for specifying a VMH file as a command-line
  parameter to the host software executable. If no
  parameter is provided, "program.vmh" is assumed to be
  the VMH image to be loaded, and should be present in the
  current directory. Since the benchmark setup script has
  not been updated to support hybrid models, as of now the
  VMH benchmark name needs to be explicitly provided for
  launching hybrid simulations.

- fixed a major bug in the software RRR server and memory
  service: void service methods were not being handled
  properly and were returning a 0 result on channelio.

- sim-channelio now uses a unique set of well-known
  descriptors (100 and 101) to communicate, freeing up
  STDIN and STDOUT for use by $display etc.

- changed programming style of RRR services from procedural to
  to a more ASIM-like object-oriented style. However, the RRR
  service objects are currently not dynamically instantiated by
  the server; they are statically instantiated as global variables
  within the modules themselves, and the server accesses them
  via extern pointers.

- all RRR services now have a Clock() method that is called by
  the software RRR server's clock() method.

- hybrid Front Panel's Clock() synchronizes its cached state
  with the Perl dialog box, while the Request() method simply
  returns/updates the local cached state.

- the server's main() has been removed, and the functionality
  has been moved to its clock method() which is called by the
  software controller in an infinite loop.

- updated software service registration process
  * services self-instantiate statically.
  * they register themselves with a static table
    belonging to server.
  * when server gets instantiated, it calles Init()
    on all services pre-registered in its table
  * serviceID's are generated by hasim-configure
    in a global header file.

- updated hardware client registration process:
  similar to the software side, hasim-configure
  generates a global BSV with `defines for all
  services.

- hybrid front panel checks a global parameter to
  decide whether to pop up a dialog box.

- Front panel now defines 6 types for communicating the number of
  LEDs, buttons and switches.  Three are Bit vectors for holding the state
  (FRONTP_LEDS, FRONTP_SWITCHES and FRONTP_BUTTONS).  Three are sizes
  (FRONTP_NUM_LEDS...).
- Toplevel wires communicates the number of LEDS and SWITCHES with similar
  types.
- Change HiTech Global board config to 8 LEDs and switches.

Partial support for a hardware RRR server, variable-length
RRR parameters, and a richer RRR specification language:
significant changes have been made to RRR and ChannelIO
modules, but functionally all models should behave exactly
as they did before this commit (except for a noticeable
slowdown).

- altered ChannelIO interface to use vectors of read and
  write ports, to support multiple full-duplex virtual channels.

- added partial support to ChannelIO for variable-length
  parameters (currently commented out).

- added support for a hardware RRR server (incomplete).

- added a temporary placeholder stub for the hybrid Memory
  service which acts as an interface between the Service itself
  and the hardware RRR server.

- updated .rrr specification files for hybrid memory and front
  panel virtual devices according to new spec language.

- renamed some files in the RRR module.

The beginning of "productizing" the PCIE controller.

In this checkin the existing structure and modules are not modified, but new
things are added so that we can build them up to the organization that we want
while existing models continue to function.

Includes:
 * Extremely preliminary version of the PCIE VHDL.
 * Initial import of PCIE VHDL into BSV
 * Initial set of Physical Devices:
    * LEDs
    * Switches
    * Buttons
 * Initial Physical Platforms
    * HTG PCI Enabled
    * HTG PCI Disabled

Open question: Who instantiates the physical platform and maps the virtual
devices onto it?

Michael P.

- simplified a compatibility bugfix in Null channelio module
- reduced the poll interval in Sim channelio module. Models
  simulate significantly faster now.

Updated ChannelIO (sim):

- variable-length messages are now supported for all channels in
  both directions.

- created a Unified Message Format (UMF) which is used by multiple
  layers in the RRR stack. A UMF message contains a pre-decoded
  header with IDs and data-lengths for multiple stack layers.

- added an explicit priority arbiter to arbitrate between multiple
  virtual write channels on the hardware side.

- modified hardware RRR client and software server modules to use
  the new ChannelIO, but no changes have been made to their existing
  fixed-size parameter usage. These modules need to be cleaned up
  and generalized.

These changes should be completely invisible outside channelio
and RRR.

physical_platforms replaces toplevel_wires as the way to represent the physical wires (and the way
that the wires are driven). All references to TopLevelWires should be expunged.

The HTG physical platform is in place, and XUP has also been rolled over to the new system.
Simulation platforms should still work too.

TBD: Remove obsolete files. Rename "physical-devices" and other things to their final names.

- modified hardware-side UMF structure to store size of message
  in number of chunks instead of number of bytes. This avoids
  having to re-compute number of chunks at multiple levels in
  the hierarchy. Exact number of bytes only matters at the stub
  level, which are already aware of these sizes (since they are
  auto-generated from RRR files).

- fixed some bugs in hardware RRR server.

- added a new PCI-express channelio module. This will later be unified
  with the existing sim (and probably unix) channelio modules to form
  a generic channelio module, requiring a platform-specific "physical
  channel" submodule, and a generic "umf" submodule.

- added a PCI-express CSR-based physical channel module which creates
  a FIFO interface on top of the CSR interface provided by the pci-e
  physical platform.
  - The available CSRs are split into two segments, one for each
    direction.
  - Four CSRs are dedicated for use as head and tail pointers.
  - Since the CSR interface provides only one read and one write port,
    these ports are arbitrated between data and pointer requests.
  - Pointer update requests are sent out intermittently. Correctness
    is guaranteed, but efficiency could be improved.
  BSV code for the physical channel is being uploaded with this commit,
  but remains untested. C code is not yet ready.

First version of PCIe driver and control program.  Both are installed
on any machine with a PCIe FPGA in /usr/hasim.  The new program
/usr/hasim/bin/hasim-fpga-ctrl controls the state of the PCIe bus
and programming cables, making user-mode access available to the
programming cable and FPGA kernel drivers only when everything is
in the right states.
