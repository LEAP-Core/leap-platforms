FPGAenv Reorganization: A new module called
low-level-platform-interface (LLPI) now encapsulates RRR,
Channel I/O, and Top Level Wires. The higher level HAsim
Platform Interface instantiates the LLPI and passes it down
to all the virtual devices, which can choose to use any
of the three mechanisms (RRR, ChannelIO, TopLevelWires) to
implement their functionality.

This commit only updates the AWB hierarchy to reflect the
new organization. The directory structure is slightly
inconsistent, and will be fixed in a future commit.

Added support for "Simulation only" memory virtual device which uses BRAM and
never issues invalidates. This can serve as a template for the Hybrid Memory BSV
side.

- updated Hybrid Memory. Some basic functionalities now work.
  Please see MemTest.bsv for an example on how to use it.

- modified Hybrid Front Panel to poll RRR every few cycles
  instead of every cycle. This gives other RRR clients a chance
  to win during rule scheduling (currently, RRR arbitration is
  solely through implicit Bluespec rule-scheduling).

- changed the method used to launch a hybrid model. The software
  executable needs to be invoked by the user, which will in turn
  launch the hardware part of the simulation (this will be later
  extended to enable the software executable to download the bitfile
  onto the FPGA for a "real" hybrid execution).

- cleaned up the BSV-side of the sim-channelio module significantly;
  some of the functionality has now been transferred to the software
  side.

- updated the way in which software services handle exceptions:
  instead of exiting immediately, they send a message to the server
  so that it can perform some cleanup operations (terminating all
  other services and the hardware simulation) before exiting.
  This method is also used to terminate simulation if the user
  clicks on the Exit button on the front panel.

- added support for loading a VMH image into the hybrid
  memory module's software partition. Hybrid SMIPS models
  are now able to run VMH benchmarks by streaming them in
  from the software partition.

  This was tested using a hybrid version of the SMPIS
  5-stage pipeline coupled with the V2 functional partition
  on the microbenchmarks. All 5 microbenchmarks complete
  successfully.

  However, there are some timing discrepancies between the
  event logs of the hybrid and pure simulations, although
  the sequence of events appears to be the same. I will
  examine these more thoroughly.

- added support for specifying a VMH file as a command-line
  parameter to the host software executable. If no
  parameter is provided, "program.vmh" is assumed to be
  the VMH image to be loaded, and should be present in the
  current directory. Since the benchmark setup script has
  not been updated to support hybrid models, as of now the
  VMH benchmark name needs to be explicitly provided for
  launching hybrid simulations.

- fixed a major bug in the software RRR server and memory
  service: void service methods were not being handled
  properly and were returning a 0 result on channelio.

- sim-channelio now uses a unique set of well-known
  descriptors (100 and 101) to communicate, freeing up
  STDIN and STDOUT for use by $display etc.

- changed programming style of RRR services from procedural to
  to a more ASIM-like object-oriented style. However, the RRR
  service objects are currently not dynamically instantiated by
  the server; they are statically instantiated as global variables
  within the modules themselves, and the server accesses them
  via extern pointers.

- all RRR services now have a Clock() method that is called by
  the software RRR server's clock() method.

- hybrid Front Panel's Clock() synchronizes its cached state
  with the Perl dialog box, while the Request() method simply
  returns/updates the local cached state.

- the server's main() has been removed, and the functionality
  has been moved to its clock method() which is called by the
  software controller in an infinite loop.

- updated software service registration process
  * services self-instantiate statically.
  * they register themselves with a static table
    belonging to server.
  * when server gets instantiated, it calles Init()
    on all services pre-registered in its table
  * serviceID's are generated by hasim-configure
    in a global header file.

- updated hardware client registration process:
  similar to the software side, hasim-configure
  generates a global BSV with `defines for all
  services.

- hybrid front panel checks a global parameter to
  decide whether to pop up a dialog box.

- Front panel now defines 6 types for communicating the number of
  LEDs, buttons and switches.  Three are Bit vectors for holding the state
  (FRONTP_LEDS, FRONTP_SWITCHES and FRONTP_BUTTONS).  Three are sizes
  (FRONTP_NUM_LEDS...).
- Toplevel wires communicates the number of LEDS and SWITCHES with similar
  types.
- Change HiTech Global board config to 8 LEDs and switches.

Partial support for a hardware RRR server, variable-length
RRR parameters, and a richer RRR specification language:
significant changes have been made to RRR and ChannelIO
modules, but functionally all models should behave exactly
as they did before this commit (except for a noticeable
slowdown).

- altered ChannelIO interface to use vectors of read and
  write ports, to support multiple full-duplex virtual channels.

- added partial support to ChannelIO for variable-length
  parameters (currently commented out).

- added support for a hardware RRR server (incomplete).

- added a temporary placeholder stub for the hybrid Memory
  service which acts as an interface between the Service itself
  and the hardware RRR server.

- updated .rrr specification files for hybrid memory and front
  panel virtual devices according to new spec language.

- renamed some files in the RRR module.

The beginning of "productizing" the PCIE controller.

In this checkin the existing structure and modules are not modified, but new
things are added so that we can build them up to the organization that we want
while existing models continue to function.

Includes:
 * Extremely preliminary version of the PCIE VHDL.
 * Initial import of PCIE VHDL into BSV
 * Initial set of Physical Devices:
    * LEDs
    * Switches
    * Buttons
 * Initial Physical Platforms
    * HTG PCI Enabled
    * HTG PCI Disabled

Open question: Who instantiates the physical platform and maps the virtual
devices onto it?

Michael P.

- simplified a compatibility bugfix in Null channelio module
- reduced the poll interval in Sim channelio module. Models
  simulate significantly faster now.

Updated ChannelIO (sim):

- variable-length messages are now supported for all channels in
  both directions.

- created a Unified Message Format (UMF) which is used by multiple
  layers in the RRR stack. A UMF message contains a pre-decoded
  header with IDs and data-lengths for multiple stack layers.

- added an explicit priority arbiter to arbitrate between multiple
  virtual write channels on the hardware side.

- modified hardware RRR client and software server modules to use
  the new ChannelIO, but no changes have been made to their existing
  fixed-size parameter usage. These modules need to be cleaned up
  and generalized.

These changes should be completely invisible outside channelio
and RRR.

physical_platforms replaces toplevel_wires as the way to represent the physical wires (and the way
that the wires are driven). All references to TopLevelWires should be expunged.

The HTG physical platform is in place, and XUP has also been rolled over to the new system.
Simulation platforms should still work too.

TBD: Remove obsolete files. Rename "physical-devices" and other things to their final names.

- modified hardware-side UMF structure to store size of message
  in number of chunks instead of number of bytes. This avoids
  having to re-compute number of chunks at multiple levels in
  the hierarchy. Exact number of bytes only matters at the stub
  level, which are already aware of these sizes (since they are
  auto-generated from RRR files).

- fixed some bugs in hardware RRR server.

- added a new PCI-express channelio module. This will later be unified
  with the existing sim (and probably unix) channelio modules to form
  a generic channelio module, requiring a platform-specific "physical
  channel" submodule, and a generic "umf" submodule.

- added a PCI-express CSR-based physical channel module which creates
  a FIFO interface on top of the CSR interface provided by the pci-e
  physical platform.
  - The available CSRs are split into two segments, one for each
    direction.
  - Four CSRs are dedicated for use as head and tail pointers.
  - Since the CSR interface provides only one read and one write port,
    these ports are arbitrated between data and pointer requests.
  - Pointer update requests are sent out intermittently. Correctness
    is guaranteed, but efficiency could be improved.
  BSV code for the physical channel is being uploaded with this commit,
  but remains untested. C code is not yet ready.

First version of PCIe driver and control program.  Both are installed
on any machine with a PCIe FPGA in /usr/hasim.  The new program
/usr/hasim/bin/hasim-fpga-ctrl controls the state of the PCIe bus
and programming cables, making user-mode access available to the
programming cable and FPGA kernel drivers only when everything is
in the right states.

- re-worked streams. The module no longer explicitly identifies
  and handles different streamIDs. Individual modules using streams
  now need to register themselves with streams if they want anything
  but the default behavior (which is to print the stream to stdout).

- removed dictionaries from streams, and moved them to distributed
  modules.

- added skeleton dictionaries to streams, each with a single "NULL"
  entry. These are required for models that do not have even a single
  module adding to the streams dictionary.

- updated PCI-express physical device VHDL code to version 02-21-2008
  sent from CBL.

- added new fpgaenv submodel for hardware-only HTG platform. The
  APM filename, name and description have been given based on a
  new naming convention that all other fpgaenv submodels will be
  moved to eventually.

- modified name and description for hybrid HTG fpgaenv to make them
  comply with the new naming convention, but did not change the
  submodel APM filename.

- removed temporary debugging code from HTG Front Panel.

 hasim-fpga-ctrl.c         Locally Modified           56 

Change commands for FPGA access.  Commands are now:

  --reserve   Reserve the FPGA.
  --program   Enable programming mode.  Removes the PCIe driver, disables
              the PCIe bus and enable's user write access to the programming
              cable, if necesary.
  --activate  Activate the PCIe bus, load the driver and disable write access
              to the programming cable.
  --drop-reservation

  --force may be specified to override another user's reservation.

It is safe to switch between the "program" and "activate" states without
dropping a reservation.

Note that the program uses getopt_long() to parse arguments.  That function
accepts the shortest unique string to specify an argument, so you can currently
use "hasim-fpga-ctrl --p" and "hasim-fpga-ctrl --a".

- added some debugging code to the PCIe VHDL import module (most of this will gradually
  be removed).
- removed all polling delays from the software physical channel layer.

Reorganized ChannelIO and Physical Channels.

- ChannelIO is now platform independent, and only performs
  Virtual Channel Multiplexing.

- There are two valid implementations of ChannelIO, 'basic'
  and 'null'. Both are platform-independent.

- The module called 'Channel I/O to a UNIX process' of type
  channelio is an anomaly and will be re-located soon. It
  has nothing to do with Channel I/O and is in fact simply
  a Front Panel Physical Device for Pure Simulation.

- There are two platform-dependent PhysicalChannel modules,
  one for PCI-Express and the other for Hybrid Simulation,
  each of which knows how to provide the exact same interface
  to the ChannelIO Multiplexer above by talking to the
  available physical devices on their respective Physical
  Platforms.

Significant Reorganization of Host Software Stack to make its
hierarchy similar to FPGA-side stack.

Summary of Changes
------------------

Software stack now instantiates and uses physical platforms
similar to the way Bluespec does. However, unlike Bluespec,
it does not have to go through an additional layer of "drivers"
sitting on top of devices.

All devices in the physical platform are collected together
into a PHYSICAL_DEVICES class, with accessors available for
each device, e.g., physicalDevices->GetPCIExpressDevice().

PCI-Express Physical Platform
-----------------------------

- Removed duplicate copy of kernel header "pchnl_if.h" from
  Physical Channel. Added an AWB file at the driver's location
  (platforms/drivers/...) which can be used to tap into the
  header.

- Removed "libpchnl.*" code from PCIe Physical Channel as well
  as the "driver_interface.*" wrappers into the PCIe Physical
  Device under Physical Platform. These are now part of the
  software side of the PCI-Express Physical Device. All VHDL
  and user-level C code provided by CBL is now imported in this
  module. The VHDL is wrapped in Bluespec and seen as an
  FPGA-side Device, and the C is wrapped in C++ and seen as a
  software-side Device.

- Added C++ files to htg_v5_pcie physical platform module.
  This code wraps together all physical devices available to
  the software side (currently, PCIe is the only device).

Simulation Physical Platform
----------------------------

- Added a Simulation Physical Platform. This should probably
  be renamed to "Hybrid-Simulation Physical Platform", since it
  is not clear (to me) yet whether this platform can be shared
  between Pure Simulation and Hybrid Simulation models.
  Currently, only Hybrid Simulation models use it.

- Added a UNIX Pipe Physical Device. Moved all C++ and BSV code
  that dealt with the lowest levels of interfacing with a UNIX
  pipe from the Simulation Physical Channel module to this
  device module. This includes all BDPI code. Barring some
  anomalous modules used for Pure Simulation (which will be
  fixed soon), Virtual Platforms is now free of any BDPI code.

- Simulation Physical Platform instantiates the UNIX Pipe
  Physical Device and makes it available to the upper layers
  as part of the PHYSICAL_DEVICES colelction.

Other
-----

- Added a Hybrid LLPI module that also adds a software version
  of the LLPI. Software LLPI now instantiates Physical Platform,
  ChannelIO and RRR modules (similar to BSV LLPI).

- Updated fpgaenv submodules to reflect the new organization.

Hardware RRR Server update
--------------------------
- updated interface to export a vector of request and response ports
  (one pair per service) instead of the old single request/response
  methods with the serviceID as parameter. The ports are connected
  to per-service queues internal to the server.

- added support for response path. Arbitration between multiple
  incoming responses on the response ports is done explicitly via
  a simple priority tree. Highest priority is currently given to the
  service with the lowest ID, although this can easily be changed
  later.

- updated interface name to conform to coding conventions.

- updated LLPI to match new server interface name.

- Added missing Uninit() methods to software sim-physical-platform and
  htg-v5-pcie physical platform. This completes the Uninit() chain all
  the way from the top level (main) of the instantiation hierarchy down
  to the leaf-nodes (physical devices), thereby ensuring a clean exit
  whenever any module in the hierarchy calls CallbackExit().

  This fixes the zombie Bluesim process bug.

- Removed unnecessary cout status messages in pcie device C code.

* Made the FPGA environments consistent with the new controller/model organization.
* Changed "HASIM_MODULE" to "PLATFORMS_MODULE"

TODO: The "PLATFORMS_MODULE" file should really be a library, but
hasim-configure doesn't support them yet.

- added new fully pipelined hardware-side RRR client that the auto-
  generated stubs can connect to (see hasim commit).

- deprecated old blocking RRR client. This client is still instantiated
  by LLPI and used by all existing modules that were already using it,
  but the interface and instance names have been changed to make it
  obvious that this code is deprecated (mkOldRRRClient, oldrrrClient, etc.)
 
- added a third virtual channel to ChannelIO that the deprecated RRR
  Client hooks up to. The new RRR client uses the original hw->sw
  virtual channel. In this way, both clients can coexist while the
  modules that were using the old client can be gradually ported to
  the new client.

- added support for handling requests from both hardware clients (old
  and new) to software RRR server. The software side taps in to both
  virtual channels, and knows how to handle each case. Existing
  software-server modules continue to function correctly unchanged.

- changed the interface name ChannelIO to CHANNEL_IO in accordance with
  coding conventions.

- Fixed a bug in the demarshaller that was causing it to behave
  incorrectly when a method's total input size was less than the
  demarshaller's maximum width. Part of the fix involved changing
  the demarshaller's sequencing algorithm - it now accepts chunks
  starting from the most significant and ending with the least
  significant.

- Modified physical channel(s) to send chunks in reverse (MS -> LS)
  order as expected by the new demarshaller.

- Added methods to software UMF to enable reading its contents in
  reverse order at chunk granularities.

Models now work with the Null cache. This should fix all regressions.

- Renamed "Simple 32" UMF to "Little-endian 32-bit" UMF and simplified the code. There's
  a further trivial optimization which I will add soon.

- Changed UMF allocation/deallocation system. UMF internally maintains an allocator and
  a pool of resources. Instead of using new and delete to allocate UMF messages, users
  should call the static method UMF_MESSAGE_CLASS::New() to allocate a new message, and
  call the instanced method message->Delete() to release it back into the pool. For now,
  the agreement that the sender allocates the message and the receiver de-allocates it
  remains.

- Moved the endian-swap from the software side of the PCIe driver to the hardware side.

When HASIM_NAMED_PIPES environment variable exists the connection for
a hybrid model between software and a simulator (not hardware) goes through
named pipes.  The software does not invoke the simulator.  When the
software-side closes the pipe the communication layer on the HW side
triggers a reset and waits for a new connection.

Used actual Xilinx Bram ports, which is basically 2-ports, each port can either be used as a read or as a write at a time. The interface remains the same. So now, if one instantiates a n-readPort, 1-writePort bram, you use only ceil(n/2) brams. But the downside is, write to the second port will conflict with the read to the second port, so they can not be written on the same rule.

mkUserClock(outFreq, inFreq) generates a clock with frequency outFreq
from a clock of frequency inFreq. Due to implementation reasons, only
certain combinations of <inFreq, outFreq> are legal:

1. out = in: The trivial case
2. out = in / 2: This instantiates a generic clock-divide-by-two circuit.
3. in = 50MHz, out = 100MHz: This instantiates a DCM on the FPGA.

fpga-components defines %param CRYSTAL_CLOCK_FREQ to be 50MHz.

- added support for auto-generated software server stubs (see HAsim commit #507).

- removed "old" RRR client from LLPI, and updated all services using this client to use
  new auto-generated infrastructure.

- moved the arbitration logic from basic-rrr-server.bsv and basic-rrr-client.bsv into
  a separate module in arbiters.bsv. Also added a preliminary round-robin priority
  arbiter that shuffles the priority every FPGA cycle. This implementation is somewhat
  naive and will not scale well.

- removed "EOF seen" message from unix-pipe-device-bdpi.c.

Add a LUTRAM storage module to replace our use of RegFile to work around bugs
we encountered synthesizing RegFiles on Xilinx Virtex-5 using Xst.  The
interface is identical to RegFile.

What we know about the bug:
  - RegFiles with a 1 bit data type seem to work correctly.  All other data
    sizes are suspect.
  - Attemps to build a small test case that fails have, so far, been unsuccessful.
  - Multiple read ports in RegFile are not the problem.  I tried two experiments,
    both continued to fail:
    - Replace the single register array in RegFile with 5 separate arrays and
      assign one read port to each register.
    - Replace RegFile with a different Bluespec primitive:  DualRam.  DualRam
      has one read and one write port.  Changed all the scheduling hints in
      our code to force at most one read per cycle.  Still fails.

The solution:
  - The bad (just an experiment, not this check-in):
      First replaced all RegFiles with data sizes over one bit with Reg#(Vector#()).
      The resulting code was terrible with extremely long compilation times.
      Every update to the array wound up being a reference to every single element.
      This option does synthesize and run correctly on the FPGA.
  - The good (this check-in):
      Compose storage for data sizes over one bit from a set of RegFiles of
      one bit data.  Thus a 512 entry x 4 bit array becomes four 512 x 1 bit
      arrays.  This works quite well.  The generated code is nearly as good
      as the original and space used on the FPGA is virtually identical to the
      512 x 4 case.  It also works.  NOTE:  When compiling for simulation LUTRAM
      DOES NOT decompose large data into multiple arrays.  This simplifies
      debugging using waveform viewers and makes compilation and simulation
      slightly faster.  The timing should be identical.

- Add a few useful options to XST script
- Configurable model clock speed as a function of board crystal.  Model
  provides a rational multiplier and divisor that are applied to the base
  clock speed.
- Clock code has a few special cases:
  - 1/1: Just use crystal
  - 1/2: Bluespec provides a 0.5x clock module
  - 2/1: Xilinx has a special-case in-phase clock doubler
- Remove check of "initializing" predicate for BRAM read response.  Predicate
  must be true for read request to fire.

- New Bluespec compiler sees read/write dependence among rules and prevents
  critical rules from firing in parallel in the pipelined multiplier.  Replaced
  with wires and annotated rules to cause errors when the design won't work.

- Make response from BRAM single cycle.  Used to take a second cycle due to
  output FIFO and because the counter we were using didn't support calls to
  up and down in the same cycle.  Replaced counter with parallel version.
  Replaced outgoing FIFO with a BypassFIFO.

- Clock generator always uses mkUserClock_Same for Bluesim builds.  This allows
  us to set clock ratios other than 1:1 as the default, affecting FPGA builds
  and not Bluesim.

- Change the arbiters to return the index of the entry that wins arbitration as
  a Maybe#(UInt) instead of a bit vector with at most one bit set.  Clients of
  arbiters can then use a single rule to handle the winning entry instead of a
  set of statically elaborated rules.  The result should be identical hardware
  while eliminating compiler warning messages about conflicting rules.

The round robin arbiter had a lot of logic depth that was slow to compile in
Bluespec and generated difficult place & route problems.  After some
experimenting, found an implementation that compiles quickly and, I think,
is equivalent.

This code has a chain through all arbitrated bits.  We'll have to switch to
a tree if the arbitration set grows too large.

- Move FPGA clock frequency parameters from model top level down to FPGA
  components.  The definition makes more sense here, especially when we support
  multiple kinds of FPGAs.
- Add Xilinx cost table specifier, though it isn't clear that a specific cost
  table is useful as the model changes.  The cost table becomes important as
  a design approaches the capacity of an FPGA.

- implemented a low-level HTG v5 PCIe Platform Debugger.

- implemented a low-level Null Debugger (can also be used with HTG fpgaenv).

- restructured Platforms hierarchy to include platform debugger.
  LLPI now first instantiates the physical platform, then instantiates
  the debugger and passes the physical drivers into the debugger. The
  debugger returns a set of gated physical drivers, which LLPI passes
  to the remainder of the layers, and exposes to upper layers.

- set Null Debugger as default for all fpgaenv submodules.

- removed obsolete "Physical Channel Debugger".

process_inst and do_channel_init are mutually exclusive but the source left
the Bluespec compiler with the decision of which gets priority.  If it picked
process_inst the channel was never initialized and the Xilinx tools optimized
away the design.  Changed predicate on process_inst to define the FSM
explicitly.

- Added a memory controller for the Elpida SO-DIMM DDR2 memory module on the
  HiTech Global PCI Express board. The memory controller was generated by
  Xilinx's MIG tool v2.3, and is wrapped in Bluespec in the form of an AWB
  Physical Device. The controller is currently clocked at 125MHz (soon to be
  upgraded to 150MHz), and uses an auxiliary 200MHz clock for its I/O Buffers.
  Both clocks are generated from an assumed 50MHz crystal clock using a PLL.
  This will be made more generic in future, but for now the controller will
  only work with a 50MHz crystal clock.

  Please do not modify the parameters in the AWB spec file for the module. The
  parameters have been placed in the spec only to make them visible in other
  modules. The entire controller has been generated for specific widths and
  timing constraints. Some of these are parameterizable and could be exposed
  in the AWB spec in future.

  The Xilinx tools sometimes try to pack two unrelated signals into the same
  LUT and then complain to the user that it should not be doing this. There is
  a section at the end of the ddr2_sdram.ucf file under the heading "Bugfixes"
  which deals with these issues. If you see any error messages from map stating
  that it cannot place any two "function generators" into the same LUT, try
  adding those names into the UCF file to see if the problem goes away. Usually
  these errors have been occurring on signals tied to or close to FPGA pins,
  so they do not get optimized away even if the controller is not used.

- Updated the HTG Platforms to include the DDR2 Physical Device.

- Added a new Scratchpad Memory Virtual Device implementation called Local
  Memory that uses the DDR2 physical device as its storage. This is a very
  simple implementation intended to provide basic access to the DDR2 module
  from the model. Performance is probably not going to be good. It has a
  single 256-bit Read Buffer which accomodates one DDR2 burst. Writes are
  write-through no-allocate.

- Updated the HTG fpgaenvs to use the new DDR2 Physical Device and the Local
  Scratchpad memory.

Separate libfpga base into two parts:  one that depends on nothing but Bluespec
core libraries and another that may depend on other platform modules.  The
base modules can be included anywhere in platforms.

Added a "storage" libfpga category that includes storage management including
heaps, fifos and cache managers.

Rearrange scratchpad memory and the connection to local memory.  From the
bottom, up:

- DDR2 device parameters are now mostly Bluespec typedefs instead of AWB
  parameters, since they are constants.
- Add predicates controlling read rate in DDR2 driver so it is impossible
  to overrun buffers.

- Add "local_mem" to the low level platform interface.  Local memory exports
  storage as fixed sized words.  The words are grouped into lines.  Methods
  are provided for reading and writing both words and full lines.
- Added three flavors of local memory:  NULL, BRAM and DDR2.
- The DDR2 version sends requests down to the driver.
- The BRAM version has a configurable latency so that the BRAM local memory
  can be used for Bluesim builds to behave more like DDR2.

- Scratchpad implementation is temporary.  For now I added two new versions
  that export either word or line sized exclusive access to local memory.
  This code is just temporary for testing.

- Add an abtract memory interface (MEMORY_IFC) to libfpga for multi-cycle
  storage.  Change BRAM to use this interface and make scratchpad use the
  same code.  The goal is to be object oriented and let us drop in different
  backing storage for an object without changing the rest of the code.
- Export multiple ports to scratchpad local memory using dictionaries (VDEV.SCRATCH)
- Merge line and word local scratchpad memories into a single file using
  awb parameters.
- Remove old attempts at scratchpad memory.

- Add MEM_PACK_IFC and methods for packing arrays of arbitrary sized objects
  in fixed-size containers.  The package is useful for turning a scratchpad,
  which is an array of fixed size objects, into an array of any type.  Objects
  are packed in bit ranges that are a power of 2 to simplify addressing.

- Support multiple scratchpad regions in the local memory scratchpad by
  allocating segments based on sizes reported by clients during run-time
  initialization.

- Fix synchronization bugs in the Bluespec DDR2 device code.  It appears
  there is no guarantee Sync FIFOs will be read in the first cycle in which
  they appear to be data ready.  This caused lost data on writes to memory.

- Adjust the pipelining in the local memory DDR2 low level platform interface
  so the read and write pipelines are the same depth.

- The PCIe interface seems to hang some fraction of the time during start-up.
  Changed the start-up loop to retry by raising the reset signal until a
  response is heard.

- Add MERGE_FIFOF interface, mkMergeFIFOF and mkMergeBypassFIFOF.  These
  provide N input ports that look like the input side of a FIFOF and output
  methods that look like the output side of a FIFO.  Priority is regulated
  first temporally and then lowest number port to highest number port when
  messages arrive in the same FPGA cycle.

- Add a pseudo-multi-read port version of packed memory (MEM_PACK_MULTI_READ).

- Govern DDR2 requests with a merge FIFO to keep reads and writes ordered.

- Restructure free list manager in heap manager to make the Bluespec scheduler
  happier.

- Modify hybrid scratchpad to conform to new interface.  Scratchpad memory now
  uses the hybrid version, though it is quite slow.  Caches (coming soon) will
  make it more efficient.

- Change the timeout to 0 for the select() waiting for a message from the host
  in simulation mode.  Non-0 waits were causing extremely slow simulation during
  regions with no messages, such as initializing a large BRAM.  The only
  possible problem I can think of with a timeout of 0 is with simulation on
  uniprocessors.  On a uniprocessor, Bluesim make take a while to yield to the
  host thread when the model is stuck waiting for a message from the host.

Implement the solution suggested by Xilinx for the Xst bug that incorrectly
assigns some RegFiles to BRAM instead of LUTs:  add a "ram_style = distributed"
pragma to the Verilog, forcing the storage to LUTs.  Instead of modifying
RegFile.v in the Bluespec tree I removed the reference to RegFile.v in
the list of Verilog modules included from Bluespec.  The new module,
lutram.v, is just a copy of Bluespec's Regfile.v with the pragma added.

Removed the previous work-around in lutram.bsv that mapped N-wide RegFiles
into N concatenated 1-bit RegFiles.  That code generated nearly identical
results in Xilinx tools but compiled much more slowly in Bluespec.

- Set associative cache changes:
  - Merge all metadata into one structure so it can be stored in a single memory
    line or BRAM.
  - Encapsulate cache's local storage in a module.  Provide a standard BRAM-
    based implementation.
  - Rename all data structions from HASIM_CACHE to RL_SA_CACHE.

- Use local memory for central cache storage.

- Local memory:
  - Add a word-masked line write method for specifying which words in a line
    should be written.  The DDR controller implements this to avoid read-modify-
    write updates.
  - Make the array smaller in the BRAM version of local memory.  Initialization
    of the cache tags was too slow in Bluesim.  The downside is the default cache
    behavior no longer matches our hardware.

- Space diet for central cache:
  - Central cache communication with backing storage is pipelined.  Writes send
    a control message followed by the line's data broken into word-sized chunks.
    Read responses are similar.  The old code sent the entire line and control
    in a single message.
  - Embed write-through and disabled cache modes in the cache itself.  The cache
    is now disabled by forcing all tag comparisons to fail instead of having
    to MUX the connection between client and source data outside the cache.
  - Remove the in-order read response path.  Clients wishing in-order returns
    must handle that by building their own ROB (a ScoreboardFIFO would work).

- BRAM now guarantees read/write ordering by blocking writes when the read
  response buffer is full.  The read response side is still single cycle, using
  a chained pair of BypassFIFOs.

- Switch to R/W conflict-free RegFile in simulation mode so simulated BRAM
  has the same timing as on hardware.
- Add interface stub for direct mapped cache.  The code is fully functional
  as a pass through.  No cache, yet.
- Clean up the memory-pack module to eliminate scheduling ambiguity.  Switched
  to the new MergeFIFOs module instead of ad-hoc logic to govern read/write
  request arrival.
- Add explicit scheduling for a number of warnings in various modules, including
  RRR.

- Add modules for conversion between a standard MEMORY_IFC and a single-reader
  version of MEMORY_MULTI_READ_IFC.  This allows us to implement a module
  that supports either interface by writing the implementation as a multi-reader
  and converting it, when needed, to a MEMORY_IFC using a wrapper.

- Converted the memory packer to true multi-reader implementations.

- Change the hybrid scratchpad to return the address as part of a read result.
  Also enlarge the refInfo passed through a scratchpad request so clients can
  add more tags, such as the read-port associated with a reference.  Returning
  these values along with a read result eliminates the need for private FIFOs
  in clients to track the metadata.

- Add a new flavor of multi-reader BRAM (buffered pseudo).  Now there are 3 kinds:
  - Large & Fast: replicated BRAM structure.  One BRAM per read port.
  - Medium: single, shared BRAM.  Private 2-stage output buffers on each
      read port prevent deadlocks.  Read/write order is preserved at the
      cost of never doing a read and a write in the same cycle.
  - Small: single, shared BRAM.  All read ports share a common output FIFO.
      There is, thus, the chance of deadlock if the client is waiting on
      a read-port whose request is not the oldest.  This flavor is useful
      if all the client needs is a tag to connect read requests and responses.

- Clean up the replication of code to support initialized memory.  Added standard
  initialization wrapper modules in the memory interface.  The BRAM implementations
  now use these.

- Xilinx LUTRAM Xst error workaround (see the previous lutram.bsv check-in)
  does not work.  Reverted to the ugly, but effective, mapping to 1-bit RegFiles.
- Set associate cache no longer requires ways to be a power of 2.  Using 3 ways
  for the central cache uses memory more efficiently, dividing memory into
  4 equal regions: three regions of ways, one of tags.
- Expose the central cache for clients coming through the platform interface.
- Reduce local memory for Bluesim to 1K words so we see spills during simulation.

Updated clocking methodology for all FPGA designs. "Clocks" is now a new
physical device exported by each Physical Platform. Three implementations
of clocks device have been provided:

  - a single-ended device that derives a Clock object from a single top-level
    wire CLK,
  - a differential device that derives a Clock object from a pair of wires
    CLK_P and CLK_N, and
  - a simulation device that instantiates a simulated oscillator.

For real hardware platforms, the wires are *not* bound to UCF pins within
the device implementation; the binding happens at the Physical Platform
layer, so that multiple Physical Platforms can share the same single-ended
and differential clock modules.

Clock-multiplication for the model clock is now part of the Clocks device.
The crystal clock frequency is a local AWB parameter, but the multiplication
and division factors are exported as global parameters so that different
models can use different factors.

Each Clocks implementation also exports a Reset object. The Clock and Reset
objects together form the "driver" part of the physical device.

The Clocks device also internally implements the logic for generating a soft
reset, and ties the effect of the soft reset into the main Reset signal it
exports as part of the driver. However, the soft reset needs to be explicitly
*triggered* elsewhere. The clocks device therefore also exports a
SOFT_RESET_IFC interface up to the Platform, which can then pass it into
whichever Physical Device is capable of actually triggering the Soft Reset on
the particular platform.

- Try to make the DDR initialization more robust, understanding that the
  DDR domain doesn't get a soft reset.  Initialization now drains the sync
  FIFOs between DDR and the model domain.  There still seem to be some lurking
  problems, but soft reset works more often now.
- Move cache statistics interface definition to common code.
- Add statistics option to direct mapped cache.
- Drop unneeded writeSyncReq/Wait from direct mapped cache.
- Add NULL direct mapped cache that is just a pass-through to the backing
  storage interface.  This allows modules to code to a direct mapped cache
  while keeping the option of not allocating a cache.

- Central cache now buffers recently read lines.  New read requests may return
  early by hitting in the recently read lines cache.  New write requests simply
  invalidate their associated recently read line cache entry.
- Central cache platform interface internal code no longer sees read results
  as lines.  Only the requested word is returned.
- Improve BRAM-based local memory latency simulation, with the goal of making it
  behave a little more like DDR.  The default simulation model configuration now
  has added latency.
- Add notSet() method to counting filters to test whether an entry is set.
- Counter no longer ignores up/down requests in the same cycle as setC.
  Ignoring the up request could drop statistics increments while statistics
  are being scanned out.
- Get rid of the long (128 entry) reset chain for soft resets and revert to
  a counter to pull the reset wire.
- Restore 75MHz HTG model default frequency.
- Add TIG (timing ignore) tags for syncResetQ sync-FIFO in DDR2 driver.

- Direct mapped cache optionally hashes addresses.
- hash-bits module now accepts input up to 128 bits, though everything above
  64 is just copied through.  The optimizer should remove unused bits.  This
  was done to avoid a proviso to set the maximum permitted size.
- Change the filter being used on the central cache's recent read cache so the
  filter is a function of the index into the cache.  Our Block RAM gives
  unpredictable results when reading and writing the same address in a cycle.
  The old filter allowed that to happen.

* Added a nice abstraction: instead of initializing a LUTRAM with all indices
  getting the same value, use a function from index to value. The old case is
  now just a wrapper which calls the new case trivially. This really helps
  A-Port initialization.

- Direct mapped cache:
  - Flushed dirty line wasn't marked clean after flush
  - Change protocol for inval/flush ACK.  Old protocol was causing write-backs
    to be allowed to go out after the ACK that was supposed to confirm the
    data reached the host.

- Fix central cache deadlock by changing rule priority.

- Stop breaking line-sized RRR scratchpad load/store into word-sized chunks.
  Loss of performance wasn't worth the area.

- Changes to Xst LUTRAM (RegFile) bug work-around:
  - Figured out a better way to guarantee storage in LUTs by inverting the low
    bit of the address.  The old code broke all storage into sets of single-bit-
    wide arrays.  The new code allocates a single array but ensures that the
    incoming address is not a register by inverting the low bit.  This
    "asynchronous source," as Xilinx Virtex 5's user manual describes it,
    causes Xst to infer LUT-based storage.
  - Add an AWB parameter for enabling the work-around.

- Tweak rule order in SA cache.

- Fix a deadlock in the central cache caused by the write-data heap's free list
  queue filling and not being allowed to drain.  Fixed two ways:  give priority
  for union LUTRAM heaps to the freeQ over data writes.  Also changed the
  set-associative cache to use a heap with separate data and free list.

- Add more debug scan state for the central cache.

- Updated the PCI-Express kernel driver to support page address translation and locking
  for DMA.

- Updated the PCI-Express physical device to support DMA. The firmware code appears
  to be buggy and crashes the system if the flow of data is not continuous once a
  DMA has started. To work around this, the physical device layer uses a BRAM buffer
  to buffer the entire DMA transaction before sending it out.

- Added a DMA-based Physical Channel. This is primarily a proof-of-concept module and is
  not being used in any platform configuration. The CSR-based channel is going to be
  used for ChannelIO and value-based RRR. DMA is going to be exposed via the Remote/
  Shared memory interface (see below).

- Added a new Remote Memory module to the set of Physical Platform Interfaces (alongside
  ChannelIO and Local Memory). The module supports line- and burst-mode accesses to "remote"
  host memory. Also added a Null implementation for physical platforms that currently do
  not allow access to host memory. In future, a Simulation version could be created.

  The software side of this module has methods to obtain the address translations from
  the underlying physical platform driver.

- Added a new Shared Memory virtual device. This module also supports line- and
  burst-mode accesses. Clients of this device use "virtual" addresses. The host-side
  virtual address is simply the C++ pointer to the memory region. The FPGA-side virtual
  address is the offset from the start of the region (starting at 0). The current
  implementation only supports a single client, and a single page-sized transfer region.
  Client software calls sharedMemory.Allocate() to allocate the region and obtain a
  virtual address. Following this, the hardware can simply use addresses in the [0, 4KB]
  range to access this region.

  Also added a Null implementation of shared memory. A Simulation version will be added
  in the near future.

- Added some structs to the shared memory interface.

- Fleshed out the Null shared memory to export the full standard interface
  (sans functionality). This was required because Platform Interface attempts
  to translate connection messages into method calls to the device.

* Stage 1 of unraveling HAsim from general Hybrid applications using AWB.

* The new "project" top-level module has been added, in HW, SW, and HW/SW flavors.

* Projects which use Bluespec need an application environment. Right now that's
  just Base. In Stage 2 we will add a Soft Connections environment.
  
* The virtual platform now instantiates the virtual devices directly.

* Added a submodel for "standard virtual devices". This will help in Stage 2
  when we add devices for Stats, Params, and Debug.


* Added the new "Starter" device.

* Disentangled Scratchpad and Central Cache from HAsim. This required changing
  the demarshaller to have a new method that makes it more like a
  soft-connection-wrapped RRR service.

* UCF files updated to reflect the new instantiation hierarchy.

 sim-clocks-device.bsv     Locally Modified          252 

Changes to make iverilog work again:
  - Generate a reset at the beginning of the run.
  - A period of 1 doesn't work for mkAbsoluteClock with the generated Verilog.

NOTE: Our clock topology with clock/reset coming from the bottom of the design
instead of the top does not work with the default version of $BLUESPEC_LIB/main.v.
I modified main.v in the Bluespec compiler directory, commenting out the
parameters to "top()".  I had to change the copy in $BLUESPEC_LIB because,
it appears, there is no way to specify a different main.v on the command line.
This only affects iverilog simulation and not synthesized designs.

* Stat vectors now work differently. The HW now reports just how long each stat
vector is. Unused slots in the vector no longer show up in the stats output.

* This means that stats are no longer hardwired to NUM_CONTEXTS.

* Stat overflow is also treated differently. Instead of periodically scanning
  the stats, the HW now just reports when an overflow of a single stat occurs.
  This causes the SW to increment it by 32-bit UINT_MAX.

* This should cut down on unnecessary RRR traffic, since only an actual overflow
  will trigger this, rather than a potential time-based overflow.

Moved MAKE_ALL_TARGET from the root modules (model/project) to the
physical_platform module inside fpgaenv. In the various phyiscal
platforms the default is set appropriately, e.g., exe for simulation,
bit for real hardware. In the physical_platform module, MAKE_ALL_TARGET
is declared as a 'global' parameter so it can be overridden in the
model that requires an fpgaenv.

- Refactor the driver interfaces so they all appear the same when possible.
  Drivers now provide getCmd(), peekCmd() and finishCmd() methods.

- Make statistics more robust:
  - Verify that a dictionary entry is used at most once as a statistic.
  - Simplify the protocol for determining the lengths of vector statistics.
  - Make vector statistic output consistent by always emitting a value for
    each vector element.

- Eliminated many Bluespec scheduler warnings.

- Added clock buffering modules to Virtex 5 FPGA components library.

- Added explicit pthread cancelation point to Monitor thread after
  each Poll. This may fix some exit-time segfaults.

- Added the UMF Allocator and all UMF messages in the allocator's pool
  to the Platforms module hierarchy so that UMF messages can use
  CallbackExit() to exit cleanly if they see an error.

- SCons script no longer builds a download script since not all FPGAs are
  programmed using Xilinx impact.
- hasim-fpga-ctrl can now deal with ACP.  The code is getting a bit messy
  since it has no idea whether the machine uses PCIe or not.  A configuration
  file would be good.

* Updating the definition of Alias with a functional dependence A -> B. 
* This allows the definition to work with the new bluespec compiler 
  (also it's probably how it should have been written to start).
* There's a small change in functionality, in that the order is now fixed to:
  Alias#(t_EXISTING, t_NEW_ALIAS), however that's fine since we were using it
  like that any way and didn't depend on it to be commutative.

Add a functional, internally stateless, implementation of a FIFO.  Functions
take the state of the FIFO as a parameter.  Those that update the FIFO return
the new state.  The state is simply a struct that can be stored in any memory.

Clearly the FIFO has different semantics than usual, since reading and writing
from different rules in the same cycle is impossible.  The code simply manages
a ring buffer.  The most likely use is in algorithms that need a large array
of relatively small FIFOs.

Build each synthesis boundary as a separate invocation of Xilinx Xst, treating
all other synthesis regions as black boxes.

The SCons script waits for all Bluespec compilations to complete before
beginning any Xst.  While this may not be completely necessary, the logic
for building black boxes would have to be more complex.  All runs of Xst
are independent, and SCons figures this out, so Xst building is parallel.

- Rewrite FIFO functions using a shift on deq instead of a ring buffer.

- Delete Xilinx project database stub files at the start of map because they
  can be corrupted by parallel xst builds.  The files aren't needed for
  command line tools.  The problem of warnings and errors when xst starts
  in parallel persist because I can't figure out how to keep xst from
  trying to create a local database.  Unless xst actually aborts (very rare)
  the messages appear to cause no harm.

- Fix a deadlock in unix pipe device when both the Bluespec side and the host
  side are stuck in block writes to their ends of the pipes.  Fixed by adding
  a pipe_can_write() BDPI method.  This is not the only source of deadlocks.
  It is still possible to build a protocol that deadlocks due to an
  algorithmic loop.  The host side still uses blocking writes.

- Convert umf-little-32 to support either 32 or 64 bit chunks.
- Simplify that AWB parameters controlling object sizes.  Anything that
  can be computed from another parameter is now gone.
- Make the Unix pipe device work wither with either 32 or 64 bit chunks.  The
  size is derived automatically from the UMF size.
- UMF header encode/decode field sizes now come from the AWB parameters.
- Add a special 1-bit field to the UMF header for use in the physical
  channel.  The ACP channel uses the field to differentiate between the
  start of a new packet vs. unused parts of a buffer.

- Tried to update all the platform configurations for the renamed
  umf-little-endian.  In case I missed any, umf-little-endian is a drop-in
  replacement for the old umf-little-32.  The default chunk size remains
  32 bits.

UMF performance changes (about 20% boost on the tests I measured):

- Allocator:
  - Use a lock-free linked list (still supports multiple threads) instead of
    pthreads mutex.
  - Switch to C++ overloaded new/delete for the allocator instead of
    non-standard methods.

- UMF:
  - Move performance-critical routines to the .h file and tag them inline.
  - Allocate the message as part of the UMF_MESSAGE_CLASS instead of through
    a pointer.  It was being allocated at a fixed size already.
  - Switch from assert() to Asim's ASSERT and change the SCons script
    so ASSERT is compiled only in debug mode.

instability, since SCons now knows it built the .ba files.

- SCons build dependence:
  - Some versions of SCons appear to look for changes only in immediate children
    of a derived build.  When the children don't change the derived build is
    not rebuilt.  This was a problem for our scheme since the parent of a synth
    boundary is the Verilog wrapper, which changes only when the soft connections
    change.  Fixed by adding an md5 signature of the Bluespec-generated Verilog
    module to the Verilog wrapper module.
  - Remove dependence on generated .ba files in SCons.top.template.  No longer
    needed.

- Performance changes:  Compared to PCIe, the ACP I/O stream is a fire hose.
  Waste any time in key I/O code and we don't keep up with the bus.

  - Change the polling loop in LLPI to favor channel I/O.  Only poll
    the expensive and less likely RRR servers and clients every 16th iteration.

  - Eliminate the channel lock preventing simultaneous reads and writes in
    channel I/O.  Clients that require a lock (e.g. PCIe) must handle that
    on their own.

  - Reduce the cost of RRR server I/O:

    - Don't iterate over unused server IDs

    - Change the server Poll() method to return a bool allowing Poll() to
      say it no longer needs to be called.

    - Remove virtual Poll methods from RRR servers that don't need to be polled.
      They will use the default implementation in the base class that simply
      returns false, meaning "don't call me again."

  - Optimize the UMF reverse extraction path.

  value is 64.  It can then be used in RRR definitions:

  Don't expect much if the size isn't 8, 16, 32 or 64.

- Add a new class of Bluespec functions to manage a FIFO.  The old class
  managed a struct representing the entire fifo (both data and metadata).
  The new class manages just the metadata and returns the index of the
  data that should be read or written, depending on the function.  This
  lets a caller store metadata and data in separate structures and allows
  the data to be indexed by FIFO slot instead of being loaded and stored
  as a huge chunk.

  checkin in hasim for a description.

- Expose the byte-masked write interface in local memory.  That is the native
  hardware support.  The old code exposed only word masks.

- Add a BRAM FIFO that uses the FIFO functions in fifo-functions.bsv
- Remove all predicates from the unguarded BRAM so that it actually is unguarded.
- Guarantee that INIT messages go out before all other scratchpad messages.
- Increase scratchpad hybrid read request metadata buffer size using a BRAM
  FIFO.  The buffer size limits the number of outstanding host read requests.
  The limit used to be 16 and is now 1024.  Tuning is not yet done and will
  depend on the latency of hybrid read requests.
- Rename fifos.bsv to fifo-scoreboard.bsv

Added support for python libraries in SCons.  %scons %library will create a symlink in the new site_scons directory.  This enables, among other things, a relatively easy way to break down the monolithic makefile.  It also sets the stage for Altera support.  The edit is a little rough, and I would like to investigate using a more SConsy object-oriented approach with the Builder and Node classes.

If any problems exist, they are likely due to bi-directional busses, which xilinx seems to handle poorly.

- Generalize local memory using DDR to support both the HTG and ACP controllers:
  - Local memory configuration now virtualizes word and line sizes for the
    rest of the model.  It will marshall low-level DDR physical characteristics
    to the requested sizes.
  - The current implementation assumes that a line is composed of at least one
    access to all memory banks.
  - Local memory using DDR no longer takes an address size.  The virtualized
    address space is recomputed to fill the underlying memory using the
    requested word size.

- Update the DDR2 SDRAM controller to conform to the new interface expected
  by local memory.  (The largest change was making the controllers a vector
  over the number of banks.)

- "-iobuf no" must be specified at all synthesis levels below top level.
  For HTG it must NOT be specified at top level.

- Drop a bypass FIFO from the central cache scratchpad interface for timing.

Changed name of model to 'XUP Virtual Devices' to eliminate duplication 
with name 'Standard Virtual Devices' used in std-virtual-device.apm.

Only difference in this submodel from 'Standard Virtual Devices' seems
to be use of a NULL central cache instead of a local memory central
cache. There also seemed to be no usage of this submodel.

 hybrid-mem-scratch.bsv    Locally Modified          422 

Tweak the streaming read code for uncached scratchpads to behave the way it
should have in the first place.  The old code didn't record a read line until
the data was returned by the host.  By then it was too late, since all
streaming requests for a line are most likely generated before the line
is returned from host memory.

The new code tracks the most recent read line request.  If the new request
matches the old line, the request bypasses the host memory pipeline and
is returned from a shared buffer once the data arrives.

- Tweak the hash function for > 32 bits.  It still does not use a hash larger
  than 32 bits and continues just to XOR higher bits into the low 32 bits
  before doing the hash.  A 64 bit hash is just too expensive.  The tweak
  rearranges the way the high bits are combined with the low bits so that
  bit 32 no longer gets XORed with its neighbor, bit 31.

- Add the C files used to build the inverse hashes in case they are needed
  later.

* Expose LUTRAM initialized state as a method. This was necessary because the 
  Bluespec compiler unexepectedly changed the schedule of my design in 
  response to changing some buffer sizes. As with a FIFOF there should be no
  reason for most users to check it, but it does allow the multiplexed LUTRAM
  to remove the scheduling ambiguity.

Add a LUTRAM_MULTI_READ: a flavor of LUTRAM with explicit naming of read
ports.  Method names are based on LUTRAM with port and module naming
similar to multi-read-port BRAM.

Bluespec's RegFile implementation is the basis for the standard LUTRAM.
The compiler allocates up to 5 read ports based simply on finding calls
to the sub() method.  It makes no effort to take advantage of scheduling
constraints to combine clients of read ports.  Read ports are
expensive!  Xilinx LUT memory usage doubles to add a second read port
and LUT memory usage continues to grow linearly as ports are added.

The new implementation allocates only dual port (one read and one write)
LUT memory.  A further refinement could allocate a mixture of quad and
dual ported memory, as appropriate.

Functional JTAG Physical Channel for Xilinx devices.  This can be used
on any Virtex chip for activities such as debugging faster physical
channels.  The speed is low (~100B/s), but can probably be improved
with a little effort. 

XMD is a pretty terrible tool.  For the JTAG to operate, it requires
frequent user input in the form of carriage returns.  It also requires
the hardware to write at least 32 bytes before XMD will deign to read
its buffer.  Just another example of a fine Xilinx tool.

* Apparently deleting that file had an unexpected side effect: it was the only
place in librl_storage to #include fpga_components. It turns out that other 
files were relying on this #include. So commenting the contents of the file out
worked (since I didn't think to comment out the #includes) but actually
deleting it did not.

* Scheduling fix-up. The Bluespec scheduler stopped noticing that things were
  mutually exclusive again, particularly with regards to "initialization" 
  events. So now we use a method that writes a wire that feeds a rule. We
  can put whatever attributes we want on the rule, so everything is happy
  and the hardware is unchanged. MANY fewer warnings are issued though.

* Remove the "initialized" field from LUTRAMs. This was my last attempt at a fix 
  and it wasn't as succesful as the Wire approach.

 memory-pack.bsv           Locally Modified          453 

- Many to 1 memory packing had an easy deadlock pattern.  The write path must
  do a read-modify-write to update the container.  Because of the module
  hierarchy, the RMW path shares read port 0.  If read requests come in that
  fill the read port 0 output buffer then no writes (RMWs) can fire.

  Adding a separate read port for RMW is not an option because of the module
  hierarchy.  The underlying structure has already been instantiated and the
  many to 1 packing is supposed to be transparent.

  Solution:
    1. All read ports are limited to N outstanding requests.  Currently N is
       set to match the corresponding limit in scratchpads.
    2. Provide local buffering for read port 0 results so the underlying
       shared read port never deadlocks with the wrong data.

  Performance with scratchpads should be unchanged, since the scratchpad
  was already limiting the number of read requests in flight.

- Debug file: for synthesized builds always use the null implementation.
  Xst was not eliminating the whole thing and fan-out was a timing problem.

Added support for xcf file type in the pipeline build.  This type allows us to specify ucf constraints to xst directly, allowing us to instantiate unused clock-domain crossings without confusing downstream tools (ngdbuild in particular).  This has the potential to collapse code related to physical platform, as unused physical devices will not crash ngdbuild.

currently does not.  

Also added new XST build which does not invoke the basicio script on
the top level verilog.  This points to a reorganization, making the
basicio invocation a first class citizen.

Adjusted when the jtag connection gets brought up, ensuring that this
occurs after any fpga programming step (by way of waiting until a data
transfer request comes through).  Eventually, we'll build an expanded
system for dealing with FPGA programming.  

I also added the -aul and -aut options to improve multiple tool
compatibility.  Those writing physical platform modules should watch
carefully as missing top level connections will be warnings, rather
than errors.  It is probably best to remove this option when
developing a physical platform.

Added python code for reading a multiple fpga specification and
generating routing tables for each node based on the specified
connections.  The main intent of this code is to provide a per-fpga
Bluespec function describing node routing path.  Currently the
generatated routing tables are very simple - directed dijkstra nearest
neighbors.  The code also provides some rudimentatry legality checks
for the user specified graph.  This code requires ply and pygraph
libraries for python.

multi*.py - parser/lexer for input language

environment/platform/connection - rudimentary IR classes.  

This will soon turn in to a build step for constructing multi-fpga
implementations.

* Add Xilinx floating-point cores to hardware FPGA components.
* Add  "guarded pipeline" support -- generically wrap any syncrhonous pipeline
  into a buffer-reserving latency-insensitive version. This is used to wrap
  all the floating point cores.

This large checkin (I seem to be fond of these lately) refactors large
portions of the build pipeline code.  This change has been anticipated
for some time, but the needs of the multifpga build branch have
finally required it to happen.  This code is also needed for my
attempt to support the fish-class simulators.  The basic idea is that
all the functionality that was in SCons.top has been logically
partitioned into sub builds.  The only thing which has not been
changed are the sw and hw sub-scons.  These will eventually turn into
SCons functions, finally enabling us to get the build deps right (as
opposed to the current amorphous blob-o-deps we get from the sub-scons).

- Improve buffering for central cache RAM latency, trying to keep more in flight
  for pipelined memory.
- Move the recent read line cache into the set associative cache implementation.
  This greatly simplifies the central cache code and eliminates a filter that
  blocked the request queue when faced with multiple references to the same line.
  The penalty is longer latency on recent line hits.  This should be offset
  by improved line-conflict handling (next check-in) that will shunt requests
  to in-flight lines to a side buffer.

- Add a side buffer to the set associative cache.  New requests to a set
  already in flight used to block the request queue.  Now up to 8 are
  buffered on the side.  For now, requests come out of this conflict queue
  FIFO to avoid having to search for the youngest request for a given set.

- Fix a deadlock in the central cache local memory handler introduced in the
  last check-in.

Fixed bug in user-clock.  When synthesizing for frequency we now use
the mkUserClock decision tree rather than going directly for
mkUserClock_Ratio.  As such, we were not inferring clock dividers. 

I also removed the basicio call from the default xilinx pipeline.
Basicio is useful only when using synplify.

Major rework of pipeline build to bring BSV builds into the new
compilation scheme. We no longer use the recursive sub-SCons files but
do a synthesis-boundary by synthesis-boundary build in the top level
SCons.  Also changed are the depenedencies for building NGC files for
XST.  We now depend only on the stub verilog files, which means that
changes in one boundary _do_not_ force a rebuild of all boundaries.
This can yield substantial build speedups. Also, bluesim builds should
no longer depend on verilog sources, helping cut down on license usage.

Intermediate check-in of PCIE support for XUPV5.  This code does
appear to scale to other Xilinx boards, something that might be useful
in the future.  Also included is a minor rework of the build pipeline
which raises our compatibility with pygraph to version 1.8.  This was
needed because earlier versions of pygraph can no longer be built, but
it does break backwards compatibility.  This should be okay moving
forward, but I would like to have an automatic way of building a
python enviroment.

Completed support for Bluespec's PCIE device.  Now passes rrrtest.
These means awb can probably support all designs that bluespec supports by simply changing some parameters.  We can now operate the XUPV5.

Removed some debugging code, PCIE link now 4x faster.  There's a lot
more optimization that can be done here (I think we're leaving ~10-20x
of easy optimization on the table for future generations).  Removing
software layers and exploiting a wider (say 64-bit) interface will be
key.

Resurrected the altera jtag by reverting to old driver code.  Not a
great solution, but I don't have time to investigate why the combined
driver is not working.  Added support for DE2, DE3 boards.  I haven't
tested yet as the DE2 is not hooked up and I haven't got the Synplify
parameters for the DE3.

Moved the following layers to the leap repository:
* librl
* virtual_platforms (including rrr, channelio, llpi, virtual_devices)
* fpgaenv APMs (except for an MIT 6.3.75 outlier which was causing warnings, and needs to be addressed.)

Removed things that now live in leap:
* project
* application-env

Removed some obsolete code:
* old old dme/afu stuff.

Stuff that still lives in platforms:
* physical devices
* hasim-fpga-ctrl (needs to be addressed).
* fpga components
* umf

Added xupv5 serial device.  Since serial is a general device, I
reorganized it to depend on a platform-specific ucf.  Some more work
is needed.  1) we need to ensure a constant 100Mhz clock - this is
not an issue for XUPv5 and XUPv2, but other platforms may not have an
available 100Mhz oscillator.  2) I need more robust flow control
enable/disable as some platforms, including XUPv5, do not support HW

- Fix gaping security holes in --command:
  - Don't allow .. anywhere in the string (even in the middle of a file name)
  - Don't allow ~ anywhere in the string
  - Check for unreasonably long script name before calling malloc
- Rename from hasim to leap
- PREFIX now set only in Makefile

Installation still defaults to /usr/hasim but it will now be easier to change.

Added the autoconfig framework to platforms like the other
packages (hopefully to soon be replaced with a simpler cleaner
scons-based system).

Also added debian package build files and configured them to
create v11.04.

A location (tools/platforms/leap-fpga-control) was created
for leap-fpga-control, but the program there is a dummy...

Significant changes to leap-fpga-ctrl:

- Support for multiple FPGAs on a single host.  leap-fpga-ctrl will now find
  a free device among multiple.
- Replace /usr/hasim link tree with a single config file that describes
  all FPGAs on a host.
- Change configure script mechanism.  A single well known script name
  (based on the FPGA class) is invoked with parameters requesting some action.
- Use paths more appropriate to Linux.

- Tag XUPv2 and HTG-V5-PCIe configurations with FPGA requests.

- Take the path of an FPGA device on the command line instead of embedding
  the path in C++ code.

Added some instrumentation to the SERDES hardware.  Fixed bug in which
errors were being treated as commas.  We now pass these erroneous
symbols on and rely on upper layers to notice the problem.  Also, I
added some synthesis flags which seem to improve Virtex5 timing.

Moved locatestate to /var when packaging for Ubuntu. Removed 
requirement for chkconfig which does not seem to work properly on 
Ubuntu since they moved to using upstart. So there are two
things to note:

1) When one wants to manually install in /usr one nieds to use 
the following configure command:

 % ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc/ --localstatedir=/var \
                --mandir=/usr/share/man --infodir=/usr/share/info

I need to figure out if there is a standard way for autoconf to set
these dirs when prefix=/usr.


2) You need to manually configure the init script /etc/init.d/init-fpga-ctrl.
On SUSE one can use chkconfig... On Ubuntu it is TBD.

would not restrict its changes to the leap-platforms-bin
package, the pre/post,install/rm operations have been
manually added to the relevant scripts. The actual install
of leap-fpga-ctrl and related files are also still done by 
rules in Makefile.am rather than via debhelper scripts.

Improved word synchronization in SERDES by fixing bug in the even/odd alignment conditions.  We now align correctly, but we witness spurious alignment events in the odd aligned case when we have back to back control symbols.  These are harmless, and this behavior can be modified.

Remove all PCIe power control, driver loading and programming cable control
from the C program.  Device-specific control is now in the script.  A number
of fields are now dropped from the configuration file.

HTG-V5-PCIe now handles its own kernel driver loading and PCIe bus control.
It also can serve as a template for shell scripts running in a setuid root
environment.  (E.g. -p switch to /bin/sh and making sure PATH is clean.)

- PCIe SyncReg failed with the latest Bluespec due to a change in timing.
  Replaced with a SyncFIFO and HTG / Virtex 5 now works.

- Fix single ended clocks check in.  I don't know how the code checked in last
  week could have worked, syntactically.
- Removed vhdl for single ended clock since it is replaced by Verilog.

- Removed redundant MODEL_CLOCK_MULTIPLIER / MODEL_CLOCK_DIVIDER parameters
  from a number of clock generators.  Use MODEL_CLOCK_FREQ and the PLL
  parameters will be computed automatically.

  NOTE: I did not go through the myriad old, rarely used, models and update
  their clocks.  Some older models that specified PLL parameters explicitly
  will now have their frequencies reset to the default.

- Add scheduling rules to shiftreg to eliminate compiler warnings.

- Code BRAM in exactly the way Xilinx shows a simple dual port BRAM.  In theory
  this gives us one write port and one read port.  If the addresses on the
  ports clash, the read value returned is the old value.  I confirmed this
  works, at least on Virtex 5.

Remove newline from end of file. This was breaking things when the XST build
pipeline appended flags, since the extra newline caused them to be interpreted
as a new set of commands, rather than an append to the existing set of commands.

This is more of a workaround. The real fix would be to have the XST pipeline
stage chomp spurious newlines out from the end of the file before appending.

Backport

CSN: CSN-leap-platforms-555
          
Improved the behavior of leap-fpga-ctrl with respect to the optional control scripts that
live in <PREFIX>/share/leap/scripts, which do extra operations on hardware devices for
certain leap-fpga-ctrl commands. Now if you want to use such a script you must enable
it explictly with a line in the configuration file in <PREFIX>/etc/leap/config. In
specific, one must have a line of the following form for each device in that file:

has_control_script = yes|no

In order to avoid silent failures all devices must now have such a line in their 
section of the configuration file. In addition, if the device is specified to have 
a script and it does not exist, then leap-fpga-ctrl will abort with an error message.

Fixed debian installation so leap-fpga-ctrl is actually installed suid root.

Backport

CSN: CSN-leap-platforms-556
          

Updated XUPV5 run script to do a more intelligent interrogation of the
PCIE device.  It can now figure out the magic PCIE memory settings
without user intervention, and can prompt the user to reboot computer
if the PCIE is not properly configured.  

It cannot load or unload the PCIE device driver, though that
functionality will be coming soon.
