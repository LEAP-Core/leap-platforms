This directory holds drivers and programs required to use the Xilinx
USB Platform Cable on Linux.  There are packages here collected from
different places:

1.  windriver is a modified version of Xilinx's USB driver
    (ftp://ftp.xilinx.com/pub/utilities/fpga/install_drivers.tar.gz).
    The base version of the driver as shipped from Xilinx was checked in
    first.  Modifications to get it running on SuSE 9.3 were checked in
    later.

2.  fxload is from http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net.  It is used
    to upload firmware to the microcontroller on the USB cable.

3.  We do not currently use usb-driver.  It is stored here in case we need
    it later.  usb-driver emulates the behavior of windriver, but in
    user space.  It communicates with the raw USB device.
