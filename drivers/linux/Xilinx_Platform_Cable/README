Recent versions of ISE support libusb (make sure it is installed on the machine).
To use libusb do the following:

1.  Install /sbin/fxload ("make install" in the fxload subdirectory).

2.  Run $XILINX/bin/lin64/setup_pcusb to install platform cable firmware.

3.  Set XIL_IMPACT_USE_LIBUSB environment variable to tell impact to use
    libusb.



Alternatively you can use windriver:


This directory holds drivers and programs required to use the Xilinx
USB Platform Cable on Linux.  There are packages here collected from
different places:

1.  windriver is a modified version of Xilinx's USB driver
    (ftp://ftp.xilinx.com/pub/utilities/fpga/install_drivers.tar.gz).
    The base version of the driver as shipped from Xilinx was checked in
    first.  Modifications to get it running on SuSE 9.3 were checked in
    later.

2.  fxload is from http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net.  It is used
    to upload firmware to the microcontroller on the USB cable.

3.  We do not currently use usb-driver.  It is stored here in case we need
    it later.  usb-driver emulates the behavior of windriver, but in
    user space.  It communicates with the raw USB device.


Installation instructions:

*** All as root ***

1.  Make sure xilinx-ise tools are in your path.

2.  In directory "windriver" run the "install_drivers" script.
    *** This may fail to install windriver.ko for reasons not yet
        debugged.  On errors, cd to linux_drivers/windriver64/windrvr
        and type "make install". ***

3.  In directory "fxload" run "make install".

4.  On SuSE 9.3 the following are also needed:

    a.  Add "ehci_hcd" and "uhci_hcd" to MODULES_LOADED_ON_BOOT in
        /etc/sysconfig/kernel.  E.g.:

           MODULES_LOADED_ON_BOOT="ehci_hcd uhci_hcd"

    b.  Apply patch.usb.rc in this directory to /etc/hotplug/usb.rc:

           patch -d /etc/hotplug < patch.usb.rc
