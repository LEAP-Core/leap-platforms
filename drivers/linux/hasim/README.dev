This directory holds links to local devices needed for programming or accessing
FPGAs.  The intent is to have standard names for devices across all machines,
independent of PCIe controllers, etc.

The following links are required:

pcie_fpga_power0
    Link to hot plug power system file for the PCIe bus for an FPGA card.
    Writing 0 to the file turns off the bus.  Writing 1 turns it back on.

usb_programming_cable0
    Link to driver that provides access to the USB <-> JTAG programming
    cable.  This link is just used to change the permissions on the driver
    so that user access is only available when PCIe power is off.
    Reprogramming an active PCIe bus can crash the machine.
