This directory tree builds programs and drivers that populate the /usr/hasim
tree on machines with FPGA devices.  The files must be on a local disk because
they are either setuid root, loaded as kernel drivers or are links to machine-
specific files.

To populate /usr/hasim for a machine, do the following in this directory.

  A.  make

  B.  sudo make install

  C.  Populate the links in /usr/hasim/dev.  For PCIe-based FPGA cards
      this probably means two links:

      1.  /usr/hasim/dev/pcie_fpga_power0 -> the PCIe power controller file,
          e.g. /sys/bus/pci/slots/1/power

      2.  /usr/hasim/dev/usb_programming_cable0 -> the Xilinx USB programming
          cable device, e.g. /dev/windrvr6



Some other README files in this directory (e.g. README.dev) may appear confusing
here.  They are installed in /usr/hasim and attempt to explain details of
subdirectories of /usr/hasim.
